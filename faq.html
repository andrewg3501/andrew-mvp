<hr>
<p> Welcome to the FAQ page! Here you will find a list of questions that may be frequently asked. I try to update whenever possible. If there is a question you have that is not here, then feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me here</a> and I will do my best to get back to you.</p>

<p>-Do I have to watch any of the recommended anime you have given? </p>
<p>-No. It is just a list of the most watched anime shows out there. You do not have to, but I highly recommend them. </p>
<p>-How long did it take to make this site?</p>
<p>-It took quite a while to make this site. I had to figure out where the bugs were, what things to incorporate (such as images, simplified code that makes things easier and less effort for me and you) appropriately. I still plan on working on this (I did this for a school project) for a bit before I get bored of it. Maybe in the future I'll make a second one of this and make it be better but working with someone else instead of being alone.</p>
<p>-Why make it about anime?</p>
<p>-Anime is one of the most popular things in the world, loved by millions. Some people may be confused and don't know where to start, so that's why I made this. Recommendations page still needs some work for more anime (I want to make it smaller so I can fit more onto the screen without having to scroll), and I would like to be able to automate recommendations based off a prompt. For example if you got asked what type you want (i.e. action), it would give you an alert of some decent anime, or on the site it will show you anime that fall under that category (example: Fire Force).</p>
<p>-What do you mean by automated?</p>
<p>-By automated, I mean in the sense of making it seamless for me, the maker, and you, the browser. You want a project to be flawless and simple with good executution, and automation is a good example of such a thing. Although it is hard to do, as you have to remember which goes where and stuff. It can be a lot to deal with, but it is worth it in the end as it makes life easier for you and me both.</p>

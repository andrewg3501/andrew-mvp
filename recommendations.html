<p> If you're just getting started with anime, you probably won't know which to start with which makes sense. There's so many to choose from, and so many places to watch them on! It may seem a bit hard for you to choose, so I have compiled a list of recommendations I think most will like. These should pique your interest, as well as basic descriptions of what each anime is about. </p>

  <p>My Hero Academia - An anime centered a young boy named Izuku Midoriya. In a world filled with people who have superpowers, he was one of the rare ones to be born without one. But he still dreams of becoming a Superhero.</p>
